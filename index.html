              Hi, how is it going? we haven't talked in a while...
            I have been trying to figure it out. Life, It's not easy you know.
            Understanding humans is even harder...i have so many questions.
            i can't answer them myself, i really tried. but i couldn't.
            all i want is peace, peace is simple but humans are complicated.
            peace is a cow caring for its child. a baker feeding a stray dog.
            a mother braiding her daughter's hair. a father playing with his son.
            peace looks very easy, but it's hard to achieve. 
            it seems that everything in life is trying to stop you from achieving peace...
            everyone wants peace, but no one is trying to be in peace.
            people lie, kill, steal, hate and bully. 
            then at the end they blame the world for their shitty life.
            to live in peace you must face your fears, you must face yourself.
            look at you, are you a good person? do you think you deserve peace?
            if your answer is yes then you wouldn't be reading this..you'd be already in peace.
            as funny as it may sound but i guess it's true, you only achieve peace in life when you achieve inner peace.

            At this point i am not sure if peace even exists, can anyone ever live in peace? 
            or is it just a mirage that our minds drew so that our souls could escape the rality of life?
            I don't know, I no longer know anything.
            I am just exhausted.

            I don't want much,
            A small home with a partner that loves me,
            A small field where i can grow some plants and feed the family,
            A small kitchen where i can cook and feed my neighbors.

            This is all i want, this would be my peace.
