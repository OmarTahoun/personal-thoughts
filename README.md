## A Personal blog (or something as close)

#### Easy on me here this was not meant to be greatest example of good code it was just proof of concept.

#### Consists of:
- HTML File and CSS file
- Using bootstrap To dress the whole thing
- how to adding a new blog works here is what i was trying out.

#### How adding a new blog works:
- There is a .txt file that the user can write the new blog paragraph in.
- later the update.py file can be called with the argument '-t' as the title of this new blog.

- What the update function does is it reads the HTML file and replaces a keyword that i have set "ADD After THIS" with the keyword plus a new "div" that has the header and paragraph i just wrote.

- This way the newest blog or piece of writing will be on the top in a nice view <sub>(LOL).


#### TO-DO <sub> There is many that can be done</sub>:
- better design
- Mark Down instead of plain text
